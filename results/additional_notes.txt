Additional Notes on Testing and Alterations
-------------------------------------------

General Notes
-------------

- Changing Tracker Version:

	- Both original and updated code can be used to track provenance.
	- To switch between versions, change the location the tracker is loaded from:
		- Original: prov_acquisition.prov_libraries.provenance_tracker_original
		- Updated: prov_acquisition.prov_libraries.provenance_tracker

- Memory Issues:
	
	- After some larger tests on Census data, tool may return error and be unable to delete existing data. 
	- In this situation, delete and recompose Docker image. 

- Tracking Single DataFrame: 

	- Tool returns error when attempting to track only one DataFrame.
	- Blank DataFrame is created and tracked for all tests to avoid this error.
	- For operations including more than one DataFrame, blank version is replaced. 


-------
Testing
-------

- Rename Row and Change Index:
	
	- Tests with updated tracker will produce error due to alterations made.
	- No error if using original code.

- Imputation:
	
	- Some versions of imputation incompatible with tool and are not executed. 
	- Same code executes correctly when not tracked.
	- Only three types execute correctly when tracked: set value, forward fill, backward fill.

- Drop Duplicates:

	- With original tool, drop duplicates is same as drop instances and depends on position.
	- As duplicates in test are added to end of data they are not detected with original code.
	- Operation is detected as drop instance with updated tool.

- Transpose: 
	
	- Unsupported by tracker, fails to execute and locks tracker into repetition.
	- Returns repeating messages which wont stop until process is killed.

- Group and Aggregate: 
	
	- Operation unsupported and executes incorrectly for all aggregate functions.
	- Code which executes correctly outside of tracker returns results of shape (1, 1) when tracked. 


-----------
Alterations
-----------

- One-Hot Encoding:
	
	- Updated tracker includes code to identify which feature was encoded. 
	- Currently commented due to incompatibility with larger datasets. 
	- In current format tool identifies One-Hot Encoding but doesn't link to existing feature.
